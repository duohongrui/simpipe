\arguments{
\item{data}{The matrix or data frame of gene expression profile or the output by \code{simpipe::simulate_datasets}.}

\item{group}{The characters of group names which cells belong to. Needed if data is a matrix or a dataframe and you want to evaluate the groups.}

\item{batch}{The characters of batch names which cells belong to. Needed if data is a matrix or a dataframe and you want to evaluate the batches}

\item{k}{k-nearest neighborhoods of cells.}

\item{DEGs}{A list of DEGs with the names of \code{xxxvsxxx}. Note that the names of DEGs are in the rownames of the matrix or the dataframe and the names of \code{xxx} is in the \code{group} characters. Needed if data is a matrix or a dataframe and you want to evaluate the DEGs.}

\item{DEA_method}{The DEA method to get the DEGs. Choices: edgeRQLF, edgeRQLFDetRate, MASTcpmDetRate, MASTtpmDetRate, MASTcpm, MASTtpm, limmatrend, limmavoom, ttest and wilcox. Default is edgeRQLFDetRate.}

\item{model_method}{The method to establish the model. SVM, Decision tree or RF (Random Forest). Default is SVM.}

\item{verbose}{Whether the process massages are returned.}

\item{threads}{How many cores used for parallel computation}
